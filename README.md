Adding Two Numbers Represented as Linked Lists
This is a JavaScript function that takes two linked lists as input, where each node in the linked list represents a digit of a number in reverse order. The function adds the two numbers and returns the result as a new linked list.

For example, if the input linked lists represent the numbers 342 and 465, the output linked list will represent the number 807.

The function uses a pointer to traverse each linked list and a carry variable to keep track of any carry-over digits. It creates a new node for each digit in the result linked list and adds it to the end of the list.

This code is useful for solving the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/).
